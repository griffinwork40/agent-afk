/**
 * Per-session mutable state bag for {@link AnthropicDirectQuery}.
 *
 * Pure data — no async, no behavior, no invariants beyond what the type
 * already enforces. The orchestrator holds exactly one instance and reads
 * / writes its fields directly; tests can construct one in isolation if
 * they ever need to.
 *
 * The split between this bag and the orchestrator's other collaborators
 * is by lifecycle:
 *
 *   - SessionState (this file)  — single source of truth for fields the
 *     loop body mutates between turns (history, current model, permission
 *     mode, accumulated usage, closed flag) plus the cwd-dependent pair
 *     (userSystem + toolDispatcher) that `setCwd()` rebuilds in place.
 *
 *   - AbortCoordinator (sibling) — owns the per-turn AbortController
 *     and the closed-promise plumbing.
 *
 *   - RetryLayer (sibling)      — owns the writable `client`, auth mode,
 *     and the two dedup'd refresh / usage-limit promises.
 *
 * Nothing in this file should ever import from siblings — keep it a leaf.
 *
